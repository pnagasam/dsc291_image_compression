# Image Compression (Group 10)
To run our project, open the Main.ipynb notebook and restart and run all cells. 

If an issue occurs, skip the cell labeled in warning and run all cells above/ below if there are already images in the `hific_ims` and `hific_ims_decomp` directories. This is due to the compression/decompression for HiFiC algorithm taking a up a lot of RAM. Acceleration is highly reccomended.
